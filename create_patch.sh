#!/bin/bash

# When working on a ticket and there are changes commited, backporting to
# stable releases may has to be done. Therefore this script is creating a
# patch file, that can be used to create a commit in a branch from one of
# these backports.
# The script makes use of git commands to figure out the current changes
# from the latest commit to the previous commit.
#
# Usage: create_patch.sh [-d <target_dir>] [-r repodir] [-s]
#
# Arguments:
# -d directory where to write the patch file. Default is the current dir.
# -r directory where the repository resides in.
# -s write diff to standard out without creating a patch file.
#
# You may also predefine the environment variables
#   $MOODLE_DIR for the directory where your repo is checked out.
#   $MOODLE_PATCH_DIR for the directory where to write the patches.
#
# Variables can be passed like: export MOODLE_DIR=/path/to/your/moodle_repo
# before running this script.
