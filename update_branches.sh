# For the different MDLs that I am working on, I have a branch in my
# repo. Whenever upstream (the original Moodle repo where I did the fork)
# is updated, I need to update my local branches.
# My branch names follow this convention:
# - a branch from the current master is trailed by master
# - a branch from the 4.0 stable branch is trailed by 400
# - a branch from the 3.11 stable branch is trailed by 311
# My branches follow this schema: MDL-XXXXX-[master|400|311]
